# Phases of The Moon
This project started out of an assignment for my Computer Graphics class. The assignment was to make a project on anything. It just needed to employ
some or all of the concepts learned in class earlier that year and be, to an extent, sophisticated, interesting, and meaningful. This is what I came up with.
The goal with this project is to model the light interaction between our Sun, the Earth, and our Moon in the solar system. Specifcially, how does the 
position of the Moon in relation to the Earth and the Sun affect its phases. 

# Usage
The program is controlled by the four buttons in the bottom right corner of the screen, under the canvas. They control the state of the program. In the scene state,
the Sun is visible on the left side of the screen and the Earth and the Moon are visible on the right side of the screen. Clicking the "Sun" button focuses the camera
on the Sun, while still keeping the Earth and Moon visible on the far right of the screen. The Earth button focuses the camera on the Earth, with the Moon still in 
view. In this state, the arrow keys can be used to orbit the Moon around the Earth. Lastly, when clicking the Moon button, the camera is then positioned on the surface of the Earth and will follow the moon on its orbit around the Earth as the arrow keys are pressed. This gives the user a realistic simulation of the phases of the Moon as viewed from the surface of the Earth and how the Moon's position relative to our Earth and our Sun dictate those phases.
